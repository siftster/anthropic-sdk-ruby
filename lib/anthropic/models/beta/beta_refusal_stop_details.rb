        #   The retry is sent either with the same request body (`system`, `messages`,
        #   `tools`, and other render-shaping fields), or with the same body plus one
        #   appended `assistant` message whose content is the partial text (with any
        #   trailing whitespace stripped from the final text block) and paired server-tool
        #   blocks from this refusal — which also authorizes that appended turn as an
        #   assistant-prefill continuation on models that otherwise disallow prefill. A
        #   token minted mid-server-tool-loop whose partial content was continuable may only
        #   be redeemed the second way — if a same-body retry is rejected with a 400 saying
        #   the token must be redeemed by continuing the partial response, retry the second
        #   way instead. Either way: same workspace, same platform; a mismatch is a 400.

        #   additional credit.

        #   stripped from the final text block and unpaired `tool_use` blocks omitted (the
        #   same appended-turn shape described on `fallback_credit_token`), with the token
        #   attached. `false`: retry by resending the original request body unchanged, with
        #   the token attached — the appended-assistant form is not available for this
        #   refusal (no continuable partial content, or the request uses `output_format` or
        #   a `tool_choice` that forces tool use). One exception: when the request used
        #   `output_format` or a forced `tool_choice` and the refusal arrived after server
        #   tools (including MCP connector tools) had already executed, the token may not be
        #   redeemable by either retry form; if the exact-body retry is then rejected with a
        #   400 saying the token must be redeemed by continuing the partial response,
        #   discard the token and retry without it.
        #
        #   Advisory: if an appended-assistant retry is rejected with a 400 despite `true`,
        #   fall back to resending the original request body with the token.
